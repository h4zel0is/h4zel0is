✿ When making friends, i tend to get awkward first because I don't know your interest and things we have in common so i apologize about that.

✿ I'm always afk and most of the times i forget to reply to all of people who whispered on me. I'm so sorry omg TT

✿ I love crowning ppl a lot! Esp when i found their pony eye-catching and impressive. My way to be friends with oomfs~ heh 

✿ You can sit with me!! If I have a c+h name, you don't have to be shy and sit with me!! I love cuddling with ppl!! >< Hehe sometimes I'm the one who's shy to sit with people who have free cuds on their names TT

✿ It's okay to match ponies with me but don't ever ship me with someone or with my friends~ I'm already taken and i have a loving wife :33 let's respect that atleast. <33

メ most common thing, racist people who loves to use n-word for fun! I tend to avoid such people.

メ people who likes to ragebait for fun too. sorry but please know your limits, some of you actually crossing the line and getting too personal which is not okay.

メ some of homophobic people. I'm actually okay with homophobic ppl—i understand if its for their religion and stuff but don't interact with me when you are being homophobic and offensive in the same sentence. It's not excusable to call out people's identity just because you feel you're right.

メ misgender—please avoid misgendering me because it can be pretty offensive TT. I'd like it what i prefer in my introduction post. :33

メ shamers—any kind of shamers. Bodyshamers please stay away from me, same goes with faceshamers too.

★ I used four names based on my friends who have known me these years through my identity! So you can call me whatever you're comfortable with!
𐔌 haze, kye, han, lou is the nn i used

★ I'm pretty inconsistent when making ponies, I'm having a hard time to keep up on what kind of style i should do because I'm easily dissatisfied with whatever i make. That's why don't copy my ponies please~ it's so hard to maintain one style—let alone work hard on it TT
